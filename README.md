# Arm-KSA-Framework

The Arm KSA Framework is super-set of the competencies (Knowledge, Skills and Abilities) that early career software and hardware engineers bring to the industry.

# Background

The Education team at Arm, along with contributions from 100+ Arm engineers, has been developing a competency framework, which is a comprehensive super-set of the KSAs that early career software or hardware engineers bring to the industry. The framework is structured in four strands:

•	Personal skills

•	Social and team skills

•	Knowledge

•	Technical skills
 
Each strand unpacks into a total of over 750 statements.

# Design and development process 

Development work on the KSA Framework began with intensive research into the current understanding of the skills and knowledge used by entry-level software and hardware engineers. This included academic and industry research and models, resulting in a draft structure and initial content. 

Following the design of this draft, multiple rounds of consultation with SW and HW engineers led to an iterative adaptation of the structure and content. A community of more than 100 engineers across the business accessed and provided feedback. To ensure it reflected the variety of perspectives at Arm, those consulted included senior engineers, hiring managers, graduates and interns. These included members of employee resource groups focused on issues connected with diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as engineers who had experienced education systems outside Europe and the US. 

Feedback centred on opinions about how the Framework should be changed to capture the knowledge, skills and abilities that are valuable to entry-level engineers. This included:
-	Technical skills: skills sets, skills and skills descriptors
-	Knowledge: knowledge substrands, knowledge areas and knowledge statements
-	Additional fields: including the tools, platforms, programming languages, methodologies and techniques which are applied by entry level engineers in the context of a specific skill or knowledge area.

The Framework represents the sum total of this work, and is consequently a super-set of skills for entry-level engineers across software and hardware specialisms. One would not expect a single engineer to be proficient in all the KSAs but instead a job/role profile could be identified using the content of the Framework.

# Structure of framework

The framework is built around four strands, each of which is presented as a nested hierarchy. As such, it can help to visualise the framework as a tree diagram. Each strand expands to either four or five levels. 
 
Strand 1 includes four levels: Personal Skills, Sub-strands, Skill sets and Exemplar skills 
Strand 2 includes four levels: Social & Team skills, Sub-strands, Skill sets and Exemplar skills
Strand 3 includes four levels: Knowledge, Sub-strands, Knowledge areas and Knowledge statements
Strand 4 includes five levels: Technical skills, Sub-strand, Skill sets, Skills and Skill descriptors
  
The Framework is presented in an Excel workbook. The workbook contains ten worksheets:

1. **Contents**:	Quick links between the sheets in the workbook and references
2. **Framework strands & description**:	Description of the four strands of the Framework
3. **Structure overview**:	Description of the structure of each of the four strands
3. **Strand 1**:	Complete content: sub-strands, sub-strand descriptions, skill sets, and example skills, for Strand 1: Personal skills
4. **Strand 2**:	Complete content: sub-strands, sub-strand descriptions, skill sets, and example skills, for Strand 2: Social & Team skills
5. **Overview of Strand 3**:	Higher level content: sub-strands, sub-strand descriptions, and knowledge areas, for Strand 3: Knowledge
6. **Strand 3**:	Complete content for Strand 3: sub-strands, sub-strand descriptions, knowledge areas, knowledge statements and additional fields, for Strand 3: Knowledge
7. **Overview of Strand 4**:	Higher level content: sub-strands, skill sets, and skill set descriptions, for Strand 4: Technical Skills
8. **Strand 4 SW sub-strand**:	Complete content: skill sets, skill set descriptions, skills, skill descriptors and additional fields for the software engineering technical skills sub-strand in Strand 4
9. **Strand 4 HW sub-strand**:	Complete content: skill sets, skill set descriptions, skills, skill descriptors and additional fields for the hardware engineering technical skills sub-strand in Strand 4

Additionally strand 4 is designed such that any role profile could be made of a mix of both the software and hardware sub-strands, no role relies solely on content from one of the sub-strands.

Alongside the development of the Framework we have developed a levelling rubric to enable role profiles to be designed. This rubric is based on the level of independent application of technical skills a role encompasses. To learn more about these areas of work please contact education@arm.com

# Adapting the Framework

When approaching constructing your own version of the Framework for your organisational purpose there are some help questions that are worth considering.

1.	For what collection of roles and level of expertise are you constructing the content?
2.	From what groups do you want representation? E.g. Hiring managers, graduates, from different offices, from different projects or working teams, from specific designated groups
3.	How will you introduce the Framework? 
4.	Will those consulting feedback on the whole Framework or specific subsections?
5.	How will you manage collecting feedback and version control?
6.	At what level of granularity will you make amendments?

Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.
Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This material may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.
